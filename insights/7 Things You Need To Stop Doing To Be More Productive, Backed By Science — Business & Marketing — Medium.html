I went to school, did my homework during breaks and managed a not-for-profit organization at night. At that time, working hard landed me countless national campaigns, opportunities to work with A-list organizations and a successful career. As I got older, I started thinking differently. I realized that working harder is not always the right path to success. Sometimes, <strong>working less can actually produce better results.</strong></p><p name="26e0">Consider a small business owner, who works non-stop. However, working hard won’t help him compete with his multi-million competitors. <strong>Time is a limited commodity. </strong>An entrepreneur can work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week (the most amount of time anyone can work, really). His or her competitor can always spend more money, build a bigger team and spend a lot more time on the same project. Then why have small startups accomplished things that larger corporations couldn’t? Facebook bought Instagram, a 13-employee company for a billion dollars. Snapchat, a young startup with 30 employees is turning down offers from tech giants Facebook and Google. Part of their successes were based on luck — the rest is based on efficiency.</p><blockquote name="06f5" class="notes-source-hasnotes"><strong>The key to success is not hard working but smart working.</strong></blockquote><p name="971c">There’s a notable distinction between being busy and being productive. Being busy doesn’t necessarily mean you’re being productive. <strong>Being productive is less about time management and more on managing your energy. </strong>It is the business of life. We need to learn how to spend the least amount of energy to get the most benefits. I am so lucky to work with an amazing team here at Filemobile. Everyone always challenges me and helps me sort my priorities to become more productive. I learned to reduce my work week from 80 hours to 40 hours, and <strong>get a lot more work done </strong>in the process. In other words, less is more.</p><p name="3268"><strong>Here are 7 I things I stopped doing to become more productive.</strong></p><h2 name="1b8b">1.

Stop being a perfectionist</h2><p name="82e3" class="notes-source-hasnotes">“We found that perfectionism trips up professors on the way to research productivity. The more perfectionistic the professor, the less productive they are,” Dr. Simon Sherry, a Dalhousie University Psychology Professor who conducted a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.universityaffairs.ca/perfectionist-professors-have-lower-research-productivity.aspx" rel="nofollow">study on perfectionism and productivity</a>, tells University Affairs magazine. Dr. Sherry found a robust correlation between increased perfectionism and decreased productivity.</p><p name="944f">Here are some problems associated with being a perfectionist:</p><ul class="post-list"><li name="3f6d">They spend more time than required on a task.</li><li name="2282" class="notes-source-hasnotes">They procrastinate and wait for the perfect moment. In business, if it is the perfect moment, you are too late.</li><li name="649d">They miss the big picture while being too focused on small things.</li></ul><p name="c671">Marketers often wait for the perfect moment. In doing so, they end up missing it.</p><p name="12f1"><strong>The perfect moment is NOW.</strong></p><h2 name="f445">5. Stop doing repetitive tasks and start automating it.</h2><p name="b66c">According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tethyssolutions.com/automation-tools-business-productivity.pdf" rel="nofollow">a research study conducted by Tethys Solution</a>s, A team of 5 people who spent 3%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 70% of their time on repetitive tasks respectively reduced this time to 3%, 10%, 15%, 15% and 10% after 2 months of enhancing their productivity.</p><figure name="2fd2"><div class="aspect-ratio-placeholder aspect-ratio-locked" style="max-width: 640px; max-height: 275px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 43%;"></div><img data-image-id="1*NVtpSgeNCP1PTQkJ_9PEdw.png" data-width="640" data-height="275" src="./7 Things You Need To Stop Doing To Be More Productive, Backed By Science — Business & Marketing — Medium_files/1-NVtpSgeNCP1PTQkJ_9PEdw.png"></div></figure><p name="1d85">Source: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tethyssolutions.com/automation-tools-business-productivity.pdf" rel="nofollow">Using Automation Software To Increase Business Productivity &amp; Competitiveness -Tethys Solutions</a></p><p name="e347">A week ago, I spent 15 minutes writing a basic Python program. The idea was to generate content from the data, which I pulled from Twitter API using a Ruby bot, and use Hootsuite to bulk schedule them. While it used to take me an entire day to accomplish, it now takes me less than 5 minutes. Nowadays, whenever I do something repetitively (more than 5 times), I would ask myself if I can find a program to do it for me.</p><p name="1e82">You don’t have to be a coder to able to automate your repetitive tasks. It’s nice to have the skills or the resources, but it’s not a requirement. If you cannot build it, buy it.</p><p name="dca1">People often forget that time is money. People usually do things manually because it’s easy and requires almost no research. It is manageable to moderate 30 images on Instagram for your user-generated campaign. But if you have to manage 30 000 photos and videos from 5 different platforms, you need a good digital asset management software. At <a target="_blank" href="http://www.filemobile.com/" rel="nofollow">Filemobile</a>, we help people to solve that problem generate even more user-generated content. Just like managing rich media, you can easily purchase a software to solve almost all of your problem on the internet.</p><p name="4882">If you still can’t find a solution, you can hire an expert to help you.

Stop guessing and start backing up your decisions with data</h2><p name="611b">If you can optimize websites for search engines, you can optimize your lives to grow and reach your maximum potential.</p><p name="7682">There are so many research studies out there that can provide answers in a range of areas. For instance, did you know that most people are more easily distracted from noon to 4PM? This random statistic comes from recent research led by Robert Matchock, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University. Even if you can’t find the data you need, it doesn’t take a lot of time to run a split test.</p><p name="1056">For instance, last week we did a few tests to figure out <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.filemobile.com/twitter-image-preview/" rel="nofollow">the best way to optimize images for Twitter in-stream preview</a>.</p><p name="e43f" class="notes-source-hasnotes">Keep asking yourself how you’re going to measure and optimize everything you do.</p><h2 name="40cd">7. Stop working, and have do-nothing time</h2><p name="a851">Most people don’t realize that we’re essentially locking ourselves in a box when we are too focused on something. It’s important to walk away from our work once in a while and have some alone time.
