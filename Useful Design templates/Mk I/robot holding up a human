robot holding up a human
i always tell myself that i dnt break under obvious stupidiy ans subjection to mistreatment bu i swear, the next time you start questioning me obvious ujunga then you shall have it froom me. 
I dont know what way your parents raised you to be. you are hardworking but when it comes to being normal...i dont even know how to say the word,... you people are the meanest piece of shit his side of the planet. i am quite greatfull for the help that you have provided me all this time. but if you think that helping me wheni have no one to turn to gives you the right to give me shit and hell, then think again my friend...i can survive without you. the only difference that can make is that it will take me longer to get where i want to go but i know that my God is on my side. the one God that my grandma taught me to turn to when all else seemed futile. he will never forsake me, he will never abandon me, he took my parents but he always watches over me. i know at times things may happend that i question him but i always know he is there listening, observing and deciding what to do with me.
But please man, your sister already has no one, dont follow her. you are his elder bro and the people you have to call friends you can count on one hand...dont make the same mistake. recover and you just may help your sister .
